Payment Management Solution for predicting the next purchase day


Predictive analytics helps us a lot in  handling payment deadlines, offers, . One of the many opportunities it can provide is predicting the next purchase day of the customer. 
We can build our strategy with  tactical actions like:
-No promotional offer to this customer since she/he will make a purchase anyways
-Nudge the customer with inbound marketing if there is no purchase in the predicted time window

For this project, we have selected our feature candidates like below:
RFM scores & clusters
Days between the last three purchases
Mean & standard deviation of the difference between purchases in day
